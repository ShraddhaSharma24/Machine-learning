# ðŸ”Œ Power Systems and Cybersecurity ðŸš€

This directory contains machine learning and cybersecurity projects related to power systems, smart grids, and anomaly detection. These projects focus on enhancing grid resilience, intrusion detection, and predictive maintenance using ML and AI techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects in This Folder:

1. **Anomaly Detection in Smart Meter Data**  
   - Uses ML models to detect abnormal energy consumption patterns.  
   - Helps in fraud detection and identifying faulty meters.  
   - [View Project](./Anomaly_Detection_in_Smart_meter_dataset.ipynb)

2. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Smart Grids**  
   - Implements deep learning-based IDS for cyber-physical security.  
   - Uses XAI techniques for model interpretability.  
   - [View Project](./Intrusion_Detection_Systems_(IDS).ipynb)

3. **Smart Grid Predictive Maintenance**  
   - Uses sensor data to predict faults and failures in power systems.  
   - Helps in preventive maintenance to avoid system outages.  
   - [View Project](./Smart_Grid_Predictive_Maintenance_using_Sensor_Data.ipynb)
