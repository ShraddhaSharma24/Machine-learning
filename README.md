## Overview
This project implements a customer segmentation model using the K-means clustering algorithm. It is applied to two use cases:
1. **Smart Meter Data Analysis**: Segmenting electricity consumers based on their energy usage patterns.
2. **Consumer Mall Segmentation**: Grouping mall customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

Customer segmentation helps identify distinct consumer groups, enabling personalized marketing strategies, demand forecasting, and efficient resource allocation.

---

## Motivation
Understanding consumer behavior is vital for businesses and utilities. This project aims to demonstrate how clustering techniques can uncover hidden patterns in data, leading to actionable insights for better decision-making.

---

## Features
- Identifies distinct customer groups based on their behavior.
- Visualizes clusters for better interpretability.
- Provides insights into customer energy usage or spending habits.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

---

## Datasets
### 1. **Smart Meter Data**
- **Source**: Energy usage data collected from smart meters.
- **Features**: Time-stamped energy consumption, peak usage times, and total energy usage.

### 2. **Mall Customer Data**
- **Source**: Consumer data from a shopping mall.
- **Features**: Age, annual income, spending score, and other demographic details.

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Normalized numerical features for better clustering.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm.
   - Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Visualized clusters using scatter plots.
   - Analyzed cluster characteristics to derive meaningful insights.

---

## Results
### Smart Meter Data Analysis:
- Segmented consumers into groups such as:
  - **High Energy Users**: Consumers with consistently high usage.
  - **Low Energy Users**: Consumers with minimal energy usage.
  - **Seasonal Users**: Consumers with usage peaks during specific periods.

### Consumer Mall Segmentation:
- Identified customer groups like:
  - **High Spenders**: Customers with high income and spending scores.
  - **Budget Buyers**: Customers with low income and moderate spending.

---

## Future Scope
- Apply advanced clustering techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
- Incorporate additional features like geographic data or behavioral metrics.
- Extend the model to predict future cluster membership based on changes in behavior.

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. By identifying fraudulent activities, the model aims to assist financial institutions in reducing losses and enhancing security.

---

## Motivation
Credit card fraud is a significant challenge for the financial sector, leading to billions in losses annually. This project leverages machine learning to improve fraud detection by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies.

---

## Features
- Detects fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
- Handles highly imbalanced datasets.
- Provides insights into model performance with various metrics.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Imbalanced-learn

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**:
  - Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
  - A total of 284,807 transactions, with 492 (0.17%) labeled as fraudulent.
  - Features include anonymized transaction details (V1 to V28) and `Amount`.

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values (if any).
   - Normalized the `Amount` feature.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.

2. **Handling Class Imbalance**:
   - Applied techniques like oversampling with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

3. **Modeling**:
   - Trained various machine learning models, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
   - Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics used: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
   - Visualized the confusion matrix and ROC curves.

---

## Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest achieved an F1-score of **0.92** and ROC-AUC of **0.98**.
- The model successfully identified most fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

---

## Future Scope
- Implement deep learning models like Autoencoders for better anomaly detection.
- Incorporate real-time transaction analysis.
- Explore additional datasets to test the modelâ€™s generalizability.
