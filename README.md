## Overview
This project implements a customer segmentation model using the K-means clustering algorithm. It is applied to two use cases:
1. **Smart Meter Data Analysis**: Segmenting electricity consumers based on their energy usage patterns.
2. **Consumer Mall Segmentation**: Grouping mall customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

Customer segmentation helps identify distinct consumer groups, enabling personalized marketing strategies, demand forecasting, and efficient resource allocation.

---

## Motivation
Understanding consumer behavior is vital for businesses and utilities. This project aims to demonstrate how clustering techniques can uncover hidden patterns in data, leading to actionable insights for better decision-making.

---

## Features
- Identifies distinct customer groups based on their behavior.
- Visualizes clusters for better interpretability.
- Provides insights into customer energy usage or spending habits.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

---

## Datasets
### 1. **Smart Meter Data**
- **Source**: Energy usage data collected from smart meters.
- **Features**: Time-stamped energy consumption, peak usage times, and total energy usage.

### 2. **Mall Customer Data**
- **Source**: Consumer data from a shopping mall.
- **Features**: Age, annual income, spending score, and other demographic details.

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Normalized numerical features for better clustering.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm.
   - Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Visualized clusters using scatter plots.
   - Analyzed cluster characteristics to derive meaningful insights.

---

## Results
### Smart Meter Data Analysis:
- Segmented consumers into groups such as:
  - **High Energy Users**: Consumers with consistently high usage.
  - **Low Energy Users**: Consumers with minimal energy usage.
  - **Seasonal Users**: Consumers with usage peaks during specific periods.

### Consumer Mall Segmentation:
- Identified customer groups like:
  - **High Spenders**: Customers with high income and spending scores.
  - **Budget Buyers**: Customers with low income and moderate spending.

---

## Future Scope
- Apply advanced clustering techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
- Incorporate additional features like geographic data or behavioral metrics.
- Extend the model to predict future cluster membership based on changes in behavior.
